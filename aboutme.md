Hi! I'm Sara Spring. I'm an educator and instructional leader working on an M.S. in Data Science. Additionally, I serve as the lead facilitator for an afterschool program that teaches female students how to code. I'm also an avid cyclist and dog-lover. I blog about my experiences, projects, free resources, and my own musings on the fields of education, technology, and data science.

Thanks for stopping by!
